## Getting Started

   git clone https://github.com/ITI-Menofia-MEARN-Team/services-front.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd services-front
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```
   or

   Open the .env file and update the configuration values according to your environment.
